This is a project I completed in the 2021-22 year. It represents a hospital queue system, where online tickets can be given, and patient queue priorities automatically determined. Allowing staff to easily determine who is next. The primary data structure used was a linked list as well. The JavaFX and Swing libraries were also utilized.
