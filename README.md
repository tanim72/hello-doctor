This is a project I completed in the 2021-22 year. It represents a hospital queue system, where online tickets can be given, and patient queue priorities automatically determined. Allowing staff to easily determine who is next. The primary data structure used was a linked list as well. The JavaFX and Swing libraries were also utilized. To see the UML diagram, documentation, video testing, and flow charts, please refer to the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHN9aNJ4G9eMN5aiW4WQ7ok0aC6EHzqR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118298630704174319467&rtpof=true&sd=true
